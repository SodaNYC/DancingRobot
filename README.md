# DancingRobot

A raspberry pi project using Yahboom 4WD expansion board for robot car, along with a 3x40 expander and pimori Drum HAT. Example scripts from both tools were used to build the main script.

The input from the hat is mapped from the drum hat to a sound, and used to decide where the car will move as well.
